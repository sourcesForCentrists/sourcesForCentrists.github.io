  <p>A family member wrote me &ldquo;This is interesting and nuanced <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/jeremy-corbyn-and-the-crisis-of-anti-semitism/" target="_blank">Jeremy Corbyn and the Crisis of Anti-Semitism</a>&rdquo; by D.D. Guttenplan. This will be my response.</p>

<p>It is indeed a nuanced if generous article. The simplest problem is a great many incidents of classical anti-Semitism in labor are left out.
My biggest issue with this is that the scale of the problem is minimized. The author includes only a few of countless incidents and then presents the case of a anti Zionist being expelled drawing a false ratio.  He ignores cases of ministers who have been expelled or in some cases not expelled for literal blood libel. Corbyn&rsquo;s personal Facebook account was in several &ldquo;anti Zionist&rdquo; Facebook groups where the blood libel was spread. When this was found he deleted his Facebook. Which brings me to the elephant in the room: what counts as anti-Semitism does &ldquo;new anti-Semitism&rdquo; the left&rsquo;s count.</p>

<p>The author argues that &ldquo;Jews in Britain are roughly evenly split between the two main political parties&rdquo; citing a 2010 study. I would be extremely surprised if this was representative of history and not 2010. From what I have read primarily in the guardian, New York Times, Telegraph, tablet and the Forward: Historically Jews supported the labor party not the Tory&rsquo;s. This has changed with the rise of the new anti-Semitism. While the author is correct in pointing out that the right is generally slightly more classically anti-Semitic the summery of that study is plain wrong.</p>

<p>A quick reading of a section titled &ldquo;Counting antisemites versus measuring antisemitism&rdquo; from the study <a href="https://cst.org.uk/public/data/file/7/4/JPR.2017.Antisemitism%20in%20contemporary%20Great%20Britain.pdf" target="_blank">Antisemitism in contemporary Great Britain</a> demonstrates this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The existence of strong, sophisticated, perhaps internally coherent and at times even ‘learned’ antisemitism, where open dislike of Jews is combined with developed negative ideas about Jews, does not exceed 2.4% of British adults, irrespective of the method of measurement used in this analysis. These are people who express multiple antisemitic attitudes readily and confidently. An additional 3% of the population of Great Britain can be termed ‘softer’ antisemites, expressing fewer, but nonetheless multiple antisemitic attitudes, often couched in less certain terms. This relatively small group of about 5% of the general population can justifiably be described as antisemites: people who hold a wide range of negative attitudes towards Jews. However, because antisemitic ideas circulate in society well beyond this group, there is a much larger number of people who believe a small number of negative ideas about Jews, but who may not be consciously hostile or prejudiced towards them. In total, about 15% of British adults hold two or more of the antisemitic attitudes tested here to some degree at least, and a further 15% of British adults either strongly agree with, or tend to agree with just one antisemitic attitude. Adding these figures together brings the total prevalence of antisemitic attitudes, at different intensities, to 30% of the adult British population.</p>

<p>While 30% of British society hold at least one antisemitic attitude, to varying degrees, this emphatically does not mean that 30% of the population of Great Britain is antisemitic. A majority of people who agreed with just one negative statement about Jews in this survey also agreed with one or more positive statements about Jews, suggesting that the existence of one antisemitic or stereotypical belief in a person’s thinking need not indicate a broader, deeper prejudice towards Jews. Rather, the 30% figure captures the current level of the diffusion of antisemitic ideas in British society, and offers an indication of the likelihood of British Jews encountering such ideas. Whilst most people included in this 30% are in no way committed political antisemites, they still have an important bearing on how Jews perceive antisemitism, albeit in a very specific way. Most Jews do not come into regular contact with strongly antisemitic individuals. Such people are few in number to start with – the small scope of strong antisemitism in itself limits how frequently these views are encountered. However, what Jews are exposed to far more frequently are people who are not strongly antisemitic, yet who hold, and from time to time may vocalise, views that may make them feel uncomfortable or offended.</p>

<p>The shift in focus from ‘counting antisemites’ (as implied by identifying the 2%- 5% share of ‘hard-core’ or ‘softer’ antisemitic people, and labelling them as such) to ‘quantifying antisemitism’ (as implied by the emphasis on the diffusion of views and ideas) may appear to be subtle, but it is extremely important. Antisemitic ideas are not as marginal in Great Britain as some measures of antisemitism suggest, and they can be held with and without open dislike of Jews. The motivations of those expressing such views may well be benign, and in many instances, they may not even realise that a particular comment or remark might be experienced by Jews as offensive, upsetting or simply uncomfortable, but they can impact significantly on the perceptions, sense of comfort and safety, and, ultimately, the quality of life for Jews in Great Britain. The probability of encountering such a potentially offensive or, at the very least, uncomfortable view for a British Jewish person, is not one in twenty (as it is when only strongly antisemitic individuals are accounted for) but rather, about one in three. Thus, the implementation of the elastic view makes anxieties among Jews about widespread antisemitism instantly more understandable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The study is worth a read and has been often miss represented. For this reason I may write up a summery of it.
The study separates anti-Israel sentiments from anti-Semitic sentiments explicitly stating:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whilst, empirically, all of the anti-Israel statements we tested are considered to be at least ‘probably antisemitic’ by a majority of UK Jews, we did not relate, in the first instance, to the question of whether or not they are antisemitic from the perspective of those holding such views. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>anti-Israel attitudes are not, as a general rule, antisemitic; but the stronger a person’s anti-Israel views, the more likely they are to hold antisemitic attitudes.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>86% of those who do not hold any anti-Israel attitudes do not hold any antisemitic attitudes either; whereas, among those holding a large number of anti-Israel attitudes, only 26% do not hold any antisemitic attitudes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or to put it another way the study looked at both classical antisemitism and new antisemitism as distinct entities; the latter being much more common then found them to be linked.</p>

<p>So to get the 2% the author states just take the lowest number found in the study 2.4% describing people with &ldquo;strong, sophisticated, perhaps internally coherent and at times even ‘learned’ antisemitism, where open dislike of Jews is combined with developed negative ideas about Jews&rdquo; in the category of classical anti-Semitism and round down. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps because anti-Semitism on the left doesn’t look or sound like right-wing bigotry. Left anti-Semitism presents itself not as prejudice, but as sympathy for the oppressed. Its roots lie not in religious or racial hatred, but in frustration with Jewish particularity and in an exaggerated sense of Jewish power.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He then forgets he has defined anti-Semitism in this manner by explaining how the lefts anti-Semitism comes from a good place. So either he has quietly switched to a definition of antisemitism that includes new antisemitism or D.D. Guttenplan is making the argument that &ldquo;strong, sophisticated, perhaps internally coherent and at times even ‘learned’ antisemitism, where open dislike of Jews is combined with developed negative ideas about Jews&rdquo; has &ldquo;Its roots lie not in religious or racial hatred, but in frustration with Jewish particularity and in an exaggerated sense of Jewish power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The critique that the anti-Semitism scandal is primarily a tool used by centrist Blairites and Tories against the socialist ignores the magnitude of the scandal especially the most recent wave when many former Corbyn defender defected.</p>

<p>This a very nuanced take on Jeremy Corbyn&rsquo;s anti-Semitism problem. Except I think we can all agree nuance is sometimes unneeded and unfruitful. I could say the narrative of Trump saying and doing misogynistic things has gotten caught up in partisan politics, used a tool to by the left and center to score political points, Or I could say Trump is a misogynistic. Guttenplan goes to great lengths describe the nuanced and confounding reality of Labour&rsquo;s issue. All dressed up in nuance you could almost miss the point Corybn is an anti-Semite.</p>
